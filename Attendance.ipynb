How to set up Google Drive and associated files"],"metadata":{"id":"4YdjzSmO9LCU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You should already have a shortcut to the TBP main Google Drive in your main Google Drive (the front page when you open Google Drive). If not, you may find it useful to make a shortcut and put it there so that you don't have to go digging for your TBP files every time you need to open them. Trust me, as Candidate Secretary, you will be needing them a lot!<br><br>\n","\n","After this is done, while logged into your personal Google account, navigate into the TBP Main Google Drive folder, and then to your Candidate Secretary folder. The path should look something like `My Drive/Candidate Secretary/Spring 2023 - Rick Hanish`. In this folder, you should have a Candidate Tracker spreadsheet. Right click on this file icon and select \"Add shortcut to Drive.\" This will bring up a new window where you can choose where to put the shortcut. It doesn't particularly matter where this is (I would recommend a new, empty folder inside of some parent TBP folder); it will be different for each Candidate Secretary. Keep track of what folder you selected!<br><br>\n","\n","Somewhere in your Candidate Secretary folder in the TBP Google Drive should also be a spreadsheet that holds the responses from when people sign in at events. For me, this sheet is called \"S23 Attendance Responses\" and is linked to the attendance Google Form. Once again, you will right click on this sheet and add a shortcut to your Drive. **Place this shortcut in the same folder as the Tracker spreadsheet.** Finally, repeat these steps with the file you're reading right now -- the Python notebook (Attendance.ipynb). Alternatively, you could make a copy of the Python notebook instead of a shortcut, but the other two files _must_ be shortcuts.<br><br>\n","\n","What we have just done is moved a link to those three files from the TBP Google Drive to your own personal Drive. If you open one of the files through its shortcut, then modifying the files will update your personal Drive's shortcut _and_ the TBP Google Drive's main copy.<br><br>\n","\n","Now, we can update the code below. There are two locations that must be updated every semester, both clearly marked with a comment beginning with \"UPDATE\" (you can do a page search if you can't find all the required updates). Above the code cells that must be updated are instructions on how to do so."],"metadata":{"id":"huDVLfxZ6dbi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2. What the notebook does and how to use it"],"metadata":{"id":"tyqeHzO6-FrA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Previously, Candidate Secretaries were required to traverse through the list of attendees after each event, manually updating attendance for each attendee in the Tracker spreadsheet. This notebook can be used to streamline and automate that process, saving precious time.<br><br>\n","\n","After an event takes place, the Candidate Secretary should take the following steps:<br>\n","1. In the Attendance Responses spreadsheet, add a thick horizontal border at the bottom of the last entry for the event. This makes it clear where the attendance for this event ends and where the next event starts.\n","1. Manually check that the event code is correct for all attendees. If someone's code isn't even close, ask them or the event's coordinator what's up.\n","1. Add the name of the event (i.e. Patt Fireside, GM 2, Kayaking) in the column immediately to the right of the _first_ sign-in for the event. I liked to highlight the cell with the event name after I finished doing attendance for it to keep track. Warning: other officers may not understand your process and may add the name with a highlight for you.\n","1. Add the attendance numbers for Candidates and Actives for the event immediately below the event name. I used the following formula for this so that it could be copied and pasted easily between events (remember to update the end row number for each event because different events have different numbers of attendees): `=COUNTIF(D235:D265, $I$2)`, where the provided range is the attendees for the event and cell I2 holds only the words \"Candidate\" and I3 holds \"Active (or Officer)\". This step is very important for SOS forms, and it will make event coordinators' jobs a lot easier if you do this correctly and promptly! The following is a made-up example of what you should find on the attendance sheet for a particular event:\n","\n","| | Event Code (A) | Name (B) | Status (C) | EID (D) | Event Name (E) | Attendance (F) |\n","|-----|------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|------------|-----------|\n","| **235** | 81610      | Emily Nguyen      | Candidate           | ehn5678 | PD with L3Harris |  |\n","| **236** | 81610      | Marcus Johnson    | Active (or Officer) | mkj8912 | Actives    | 4 (`=COUNTIF(C235:C240, $I$3)`) |\n","| **237** | 81610      | Olivia Martinez   | Active (or Officer) | Olm3155 | Candidates | 2 (`=COUNTIF(C235:C240, $I$2)`) |\n","| **238** | 81610      | Nathan Patel      | Active (or Officer) | Np4321 |           |\n","| **239** | 81610      | Rachel Lee        | Active (or Officer) | RKL9986 |           |\n","| **240** | 81610      | Daniel Kim        | Candidate           | dsk7451 |           |\n","\n","5. Now the attendance sheet is ready, so it's time to work with the Tracker spreadsheet! Open it and navigate to whichever tab corresponds to the event that you're doing attendance for (i.e. Socials, Meetings, etc.). Add the event to a new column. This may involve creating a new column, or just simply add the event's name to an existing empty column. (On a slightly unrelated note that is very important and very easy to forget to do: if the event is a fireside or PD, make sure to update the fireside/PD counter on the right of the internal tab. This can easily be automated if a future Candidate Secretary is bored one day). Here, the event's name should be exactly the same as the name you used in the attendance sheet. For example, if I'm doing attendance for the example event in the table above the event name at the top of the column in the internal tab would be \"PD with L3Harris\".\n","5. The set-up is done, and it's time to run the attendance script! To run a cell in a Python notebook, click on the cell and press shift+enter (or ctrl+enter if you don't want to also select the next cell). The code cells here must be run in order. Alternatively, pressing ctrl+F9 on Windows will run all cells, which is adequate for this task (click Runtime in the taskbar for the shortcut on other operating systems). The first code cell will ask for a few inputs. For the event name, input the same name you used in the attendance sheet and Tracker spreadsheet (i.e. PD with L3Harris). The number of points is only the number and can be found in the newsletter or GM slides if unsure. Finally, the event type is \"social\", \"service\", \"internal\", or \"meeting\". The code may print a few important notes. If someone accidentally signed in more than once, then their EID will show up so that the Candidate Secretary may remove one of their sign-ins from the attendance sheet (to prevent mistakes in SOS forms). Also, if the EID someone entered was not found in the list of TBP members' EIDs, then the EID not found will be displayed. This is usually the result of someone mistyping their EID, but it could also be the result of someone signing in for someone else. Unfortunately, this mistake must be fixed by manually entering their points on the Tracker spreadsheet.\n","5. If everything has been set up correctly, running the notebook's code should automatically take the attendance from the attendance sheet and update the corresponding tab of the Tracker spreadsheet! Pretty cool stuff, eh?\n","\n","The following is a brief explanation of how the script works:\n","* Open the attendance sheet and find the sign-ins associated with the given event name. If the given event is the most recent event, then it will look at all sign-ins until the end. If there has been another event after the given event, then it will only use sign-ins until the start of the next event.\n","* Look for and display duplicate sign-ins.\n","* Open the correct tab of the Tracker spreadsheet. Find the column for the given event and isolate the corresponding cells.\n","* For every TBP member, check if their EID appeared in the EIDs used to sign-in. If so, put the number of points in the corresponding cell in the Tracker.\n","* Check whether any EIDs were used to sign in that were not found in the TBP member list."],"metadata":{"id":"52r4jADE-Lfo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3.
